*PERSON pulls arms close, shivering slightly*
"Did it just get colder, or is it just me?"
*PERSON starts rubbing hands together for warmth*
"Feels like a sudden chill… strange"
*PERSON checks the thermostat, frowning.*
"I should've brought a sweater"
*PERSON breathes into hands to warm them*
"Anyone else feel a draught?"
*PERSON wraps arms around themselves*
"It’s like the cold’s creeping in… unsettling"
*PERSON touches own cheeks, visibly affected*
"The temperature just plummeted, didn’t it?"
*PERSON shrugs it off, though still shivering*
"Weird… rooms don’t normally shift like this"
*PERSON paces back and forth to stay warm*
"Is this some sort of test or prank?"
*PERSON ajusts their clothing to cover more skin*
"I’m not sure if it’s just me, but this cold feels unnatural"
*PERSON examines the air for a source of the cold*
"It's as if something just sucked the warmth out of the room"
