*PERSON's eyes dart around as if disturbed*
"A cruel trick, testing my patience..."
*PERSON'S form seems to shift subtly, growing unstable*
"Trying to disturb my essence, are you?"
*PERSON momentarily loses composure, expression twisted*
"This sound… it grates on more than just the ears"
*PERSON'S body flickers in response to the sound... Or maybe it even shifts?*
"Stop this racket, before I lose control"
*PERSON covers ears briefly before regaining composure*
"You think this can unravel me?"
*PERSON glows faintly as if some inner tension is building*
"Enough! This frequency unsettles my very core"
*PERSON shudders slightly, form wavering at the edges*
"Such a weak tactic, but it… bothers me"
*PERSON grimaces, showing signs of agitation*
"A buzzing… like ants crawling through my mind"
*PERSON'S eyes briefly flash an unnatural color*
"If you wish to anger me, you’re succeeding"
*Subtle cracks appear on the surface of PERSON'S form*
"Are you trying to make me lose the shape of my soul? Good luck with that"
