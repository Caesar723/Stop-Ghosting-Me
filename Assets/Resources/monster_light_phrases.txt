*PERSON'S eyes glow faintly, piercing the darkness*
"Ah, the darkness… my natural element"
"You think darkness will hide you from me?"
"Bold to trap yourself in the dark with me"
*Shadows around PERSON seem to grow thicker*
"I thrive where light dares not go"
"The dark only brings out my true nature"
*PERSON glows faintly, eyes reflecting in an unnatural way*
"Such a lovely cloak, the absence of light"
"I am at home here, in the void you’ve created"	
*PERSON sways slightly, form melting into the shadows*
"Do you feel that shiver? That’s me"
"The darkness reveals as much as it hides"
*PERSON emits a low, guttural sound that fades quickly*
"I’ll show you why the dark fears me"
"Ah, you think darkness is your ally? But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!"
