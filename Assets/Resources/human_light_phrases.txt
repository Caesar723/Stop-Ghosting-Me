*PERSON tenses up, eyes scanning the darkened room*	
"Did... did the lights just go out?"
*PERSON reaches for something to steady themselves*
"I don’t like this. Not one bit"
*PERSON takes a cautious step back, visibly uneasy*
"This is creepy… why are the lights off?"
"Let’s... Let's get the lights back on, okay?"
*PERSON takes a deep breath, trying to stay calm*
"Is someone messing with the lights?"	
*PERSON looks around, straining to see in the darkness*
"I can't see a thing. This is unsettling"
*PERSON stands perfectly still, listening carefully*
"It feels like something’s... watching us"
*PERSON shivers, unsettled by the darkness*
"This place feels even worse in the dark"
*PERSON squints, trying to make out shapes*
"Let’s not linger in the dark, alright?"
*PERSON hugs arms close, visibly uncomfortable*
"I don’t know what’s going on, but I don’t like it"
