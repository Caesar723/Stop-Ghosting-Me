*PERSON covers ears, wincing slightly*
"What is that noise? It’s piercing!"
*PERSON shakes head as if trying to shake off the discomfor.*
"Is there some kind of high-pitched ring in here?"
*PERSON squints, looking around for the source of noises*
"Am I the only one hearing this awful sound?"
*PERSON frowns, looking visibly uncomfortable*
"I don’t know what that is, but it’s… irritating"	
*PERSON moves a little, as if trying to escape the sound*
"That’s enough to drive someone mad"
*PERSON places hands over ears, grimacing*
"It’s like a mosquito buzzing in my brain"
*PERSON tenses up, as if resisting the urge to cover ears*
"Someone turn off that high-pitched squeal!"
*PERSON looks around nervously, clearly affected*
"Is this a test or some sort of strange alarm?"
*PERSON closes eyes, taking a deep breath to ignore the sound*
"I think I’m starting to get a headache"
*PERSON rubs temples, visibly irritated by the noise*
"This sound… it’s unbearable!"
