*PERSON'S eyes narrow, observing surroundings cautiously*
"Suddenly, I feel sleepy..."
*PERSON flares nostrils, almost detecting something in the cold*
"You’re playing games with something you shouldn't while I am here"	
"Did you think that would affect me?"
*The shape of PERSON'S form flickers briefly*
"Cold… suits me well enough"
*PERSON looks around as if sensing a threat*
"I wonder what you hoped to accomplish"
*PERSON'S bloodshot eyes blink slowly, unbothered*
"Foolish humans, always tampering with forces beyond them"
*PERSON'S eyes shift to an unusual color in the dim chill*
"I find this attempt amusing"
*PERSON breathes out a mist, unaffected by cold*
"Coldness is home, for creatures like me"
*It seems like a mist starts coming out of a person*
"You’d need more than a chill to see my true form"
*PERSON flickers, revealing a glimpse of something monstrous*
"Such a weak attempt, but I admire the effort"
