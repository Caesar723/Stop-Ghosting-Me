	"Weird… rooms don’t normally shift like this"
	*PERSON paces back and forth to stay warm*
	"Is this some sort of test or prank?"
	*PERSON ajusts their clothing to cover more skin*
	"I’m not sure if it’s just me, but this cold feels unnatural"

	*PERSON'S eyes narrow, observing surroundings cautiously*

	"Cold… suits me well enough"
	*PERSON looks around as if sensing a threat*
	"I wonder what you hoped to accomplish"
	*PERSON'S bloodshot eyes blink slowly, unbothered*
	"Foolish humans, always tampering with forces beyond them"

	"I find this attempt amusing"
	*PERSON breathes out a mist, unaffected by cold*
	"Coldness is home, for creatures like me"
	*It seems like a mist starts coming out of a person*

Noises:
Human Reactions
	*PERSON overs ears, wincing slightly*
	"What is that noise? It’s piercing!"
	*PERSON shakes head as if trying to shake off the discomfor.*
	"Is there some kind of high-pitched ring in here?"
	*PERSON squints, looking around for the source of noises*
	"Am I the only one hearing this awful sound?"
	*PERSON frowns, looking visibly uncomfortable*
	"I don’t know what that is, but it’s… irritating"
	*PERSON moves a little, as if trying to escape the sound*
	"That’s enough to drive someone mad"
	*PERSON Places hands over ears, grimacing*
	"It’s like a mosquito buzzing in my brain"
	*PERSON tenses up, as if resisting the urge to cover ears*
	"Someone turn off that high-pitched squeal!"
	*PERSON looks around nervously, clearly affected*
	"Is this a test or some sort of strange alarm?"

Monster Reactions

	"A cruel trick, testing my patience..."
	*PERSON'S form seems to shift subtly, growing unstable*
	"Trying to disturb my essence, are you?"
	*PERSON momentarily loses composure, expression twisted*
	"This sound… it grates on more than just the ears"
	*PERSON'S body flickers in response to the sound... Or maybe it even shifts?*
	"Stop this racket, before I lose control"
	*PERSON covers ears briefly before regaining composure*
	"You think this can unravel me?"
	*PERSON glows faintly as if some inner tension is building*
	"Enough! This frequency unsettles my very core"
	*PERSON shudders slightly, form wavering at the edges*
	"Such a weak tactic, but it… bothers me"
	*PERSON grimaces, showing signs of agitation*
	"A buzzing… like ants crawling through my mind"
	*PERSON'S eyes briefly flash an unnatural color*
	"If you wish to anger me, you’re succeeding"
	*Subtle cracks appear on the surface of PERSON'S form*
	"Are you trying to make me lose the shape of my soul? Good luck with that"

Light:
Human Reactions
	*PERSON tenses up, eyes scanning the darkened room*
	"Did... did the lights just go out?"
	*PERSON reaches for something to steady themselves*
	"I don’t like this. Not one bit"
	*PERSON takes a cautious step back, visibly uneasy*
	"This is creepy… why are the lights off?"
	"Let’s... Let's get the lights back on, okay?"
	*PERSON takes a deep breath, trying to stay calm*
	"Is someone messing with the lights?"
	*PERSON looks around, straining to see in the darkness*
	"I can't see a thing. This is unsettling"
	*PERSON stands perfectly still, listening carefully*
	"It feels like something’s... watching us"
	*PERSON shivers, unsettled by the darkness*
	"This place feels even worse in the dark"
	*PERSON squints, trying to make out shapes*
	"Let’s not linger in the dark, alright?"
	*PERSON hugs arms close, visibly uncomfortable*
	"I don’t know what’s going on, but I don’t like it"
Monster Reactions
	*PERSON'S eyes glow faintly, piercing the darkness*
	"Ah, the darkness… my natural element"
	"You think darkness will hide you from me?"
	"Bold to trap yourself in the dark with me"
	*Shadows around PERSON seem to grow thicker*
	"I thrive where light dares not go"
	"The dark only brings out my true nature"
	*PERSON glows faintly, eyes reflecting in an unnatural way*
	"Such a lovely cloak, the absence of light"
	"I am at home here, in the void you’ve created"
	*PERSON sways slightly, form melting into the shadows*
	"Do you feel that shiver? That’s me"
	"The darkness reveals as much as it hides"
	*PERSON emits a low, guttural sound that fades quickly*
	"I’ll show you why the dark fears me"
	"Ah, you think darkness is your ally? But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!"
