About the game:  

Although the game was developed mainly in a way that makes user go into it blindly, we decided to leave some explanations due to the fact
that it takes some time to understand. The main character is a security officer on probation, whose job is to make sure that only humans can enter,
and declining access to the monsters. Although monsters look similar to the humans, there are some ways to "lure them out": by changing environment
conditions (in the game, those are rectengular buttons). By changing some conditions, people and monsters can react in a different way to the changes (although
with each new day, more neutral reactions can appear, whiich are the same for humans and monsters). Not only that, but player also can use cameras (round buttons), 
which allow officer to see some specific parts of the monsters (explained in the game when hover over the buttons. Those buttons also use some limited energy). Those
cameras are a seperate windows from the game application

Additionally, there are 4 endings that players can get (if you don't won't to spoil it, skip this part):

Ending 1: do a good or decent job in recognizing the monsters ("Good ending")  
Ending 2: do a bad job ("Bad ending")  
Ending 3: try "ghosting" all the visitors (Secret ending 1)  
Ending 4: be REALLY indecisive (Secret ending 2)  

Sorry if all of this sounded complicated, hopefully it is easier to understand everything in game. Have fun!
